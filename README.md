# World Energy Consumption & Distribution visualized in Power BI


The project contains:
- 5 visualization slides
- 4 data analysis slides

Source data was of a good quality, clean and did not require data cleansing. 

Project goal was to create the Dashboard that:
- is easy to read,
- follows the same visualization pattern,
- enables the end user to understand the energy consumption and distribution


The visualization slides are as follows:

1. Energy Distribution - Countries

2. Energy Distribution - Regions

3. Map - Fossil Fuels % Change from 2000 to 2019 (red means that fossil fuels usage increased, green that decreased)

5. Energy Usage - Continents - for this visualization the quartiles were calculated. It was based on the energy usage for each country. Then each quartile was assigned to the Category
